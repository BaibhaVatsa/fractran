# Fractran 

Runs fractran code. Written in Rust. 
Wrote it just to learn more about Rust and programming languages.

<!-- - take in input n
- take in input vector. data type is tuples of i128. two parts to data, pre '/' and post'/'. pre '/' take in number and just don't care about anything till you see '/', skip it and switch to post '/' mode. In post '/' mode, take in everything as a number till you get to space. once you reach space, next iteration of loop and back to pre '/' mode.
- while there is some q in the list such that n % q == 0, replace n with n*p/q, print the list, remove p/q, and reiterate. Once no such q exists, exit the loop.
- print n on screen -->
